title: Pull Right Affect Bootstrap col-sm-4
date: 2017-02-09

col-sm-8 col-sm-4 can be same line when screen is larger than xs screen size even col-sm-4 has a child class called pull-right, but when xs screen, the col-sm-4 has a nothing in it, and the child class pull-right content is not in the col-sm-4 container.

Then, I add the col-xs-8 and col-xs-4 respectively, the child is in the parent container now.

> Something about the confliction. If you know why and had the same experience, feel free to leave a comment!
