Github pages is really convenient I have to admit. 

It is also not perfect. After I did some change locally or on github repo, it's gonna take 4ever to see the result. Just because of the delay, it's hard to debug since you don't know when and where you did the change if you didn't wait till you see the result. 

But I can try to switch to another browser to see the affect, which is having no choice right now. 

:/
