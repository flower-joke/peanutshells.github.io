然而，生活离不开会计。于是，我就想发一篇好文，记录一些基础知识。

# 2. Concepts

## Accounts Payable

The `accounts payable` process involves reviewing an enormous amount of detail to ensure that only legitimate  and accurate amounts are entered in the accounting system. Much of the information that needs to be reviewed will be found in the following documents:
<ul>
  <li>purchase orders issued by the company</li>
  <li>receiving reports issued by the company</li>
  <li>invoices from the company's vendors</li>
  <li>contracts and other agreements</li>
</ul>
The accuracy and completeness of a company's financial statements are dependent on the accounts payable process. A well-run accounts payable process will include:
<ul>
  <li>the timely processing of accurate and legitimate vendor invoices,</li>
  <li>accurate recording in the appropriate general ledger  accounts, and</li>
  <li>the accrual of obligations and expenses that have not yet been completely processed.</li>
</ul>
The efficiency and effectiveness of the accounts payable process will also affect the company's cash position, credit rating, and relationships with its suppliers.

>**Examples 举个栗子**

>To illustrate this, let's assume that DeliverCorp provides a service for YourCo at a cost of $600 on May 1 and sends an invoice dated >May 1 for $600. The invoice specifies that the amount will be due in 30 days. (We will assume throughout our explanation that the >companies follow the accrual method of accounting.)

## Purchase order

A `purchase order` or PO is prepared by a company to communicate and document precisely what the company is ordering from a vendor. The paper version of a purchase order is a multi-copy form with copies distributed to several people. The people or departments receiving a copy of the PO include:

the person requesting that a PO be issued for the goods or services
the accounts payable department
the receiving department
the vendor
the person preparing the purchase order
The purchase order will indicate a PO number, date prepared, company name, vendor name, name and phone number of a contact person, a description of the items being purchased, the quantity, unit prices, shipping method, date needed, and other pertinent information.

One copy of the purchase order will be used in the three-way match, which we will discuss later.

## Receiving report

A `receiving report` is a company's documentation of the goods it has received. The receiving report may be a paper form or it may be a computer entry. The quantity and description of the goods shown on the receiving report should be compared to the information on the company's purchase order.

After the receiving report and purchase order information are reconciled, they need to be compared to the vendor invoice. Hence, the receiving report is the second of the three documents in the three-way match (which will be discussed shortly).

## Vendor Invoice

The supplier or vendor will send an invoice to the company that had received the goods and/or services on credit. When the invoice or bill is received, the customer will refer to it as a vendor invoice. Each vendor invoice is routed to accounts payable for processing. After the invoice is verified and approved, the amount will be credited to the company's Accounts Payable account and will also be debited to another account (often as an expense or asset).

A common technique for verifying a `vendor invoice` is the three-way match.

## Three-way match

The accounts payable process often uses a technique known as the `three-way match` to assure that only valid and accurate vendor invoices are recorded and paid. The three-way match involves the following:

## Vouchers

Some companies use a `voucher` in order to document or "vouch for" the completeness of the approval process. You can visualize a voucher as a cover sheet for attaching the supporting documents (purchase order, receiving report, vendor's invoice, etc.) and for noting the approvals, account numbers, and other information for each vendor invoice or bill.

When the vendor invoice is paid, the voucher and its attachments (including a copy of the check that was issued) will be stored in a paid voucher/invoice file. If paper documents are involved, an office machine could perforate the word "PAID" through the voucher and its attachments. This is done to assure that a duplicate payment will not occur.

The unpaid invoices and vouchers will be held in an open file.

## Vendor invoices without purchase orders or receiving reports

Not all vendor invoices will have purchase orders or receiving reports. Hence, the three-way match is not always possible. For example, a company does not issue a purchase order to its electric utility for a pre-established amount of electricity for the following month. The same is true for the telephone, natural gas, sewer and water, freight-in, and so on.

There are also payments that are required every month in order to fulfill lease agreements or other contracts. Examples include the monthly rent for a storage facility, office rent, automobile payments, equipment leases, maintenance agreements, etc. Even though these obligations will not have purchase orders, the responsibility is unchanged: pay only the amounts that are legitimate and accurate.

## Statements from vendors

Vendors often send `statements` to their customers to indicate the amounts (listed by invoice number) that remain unpaid. When a vendor statement is received the details on the statement should be compared to the company's records.

The fact that a company can be receiving both invoices and statements from a vendor means there is the potential of a duplicate payment. In order to avoid making a duplicate payment, companies often establish the following rule: Pay only from vendor invoices; never pay from vendor statements.
