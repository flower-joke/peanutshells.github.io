***SEEING A DENTIST 
## Retainers
```
Please wear your retainer full time (except wheneating and brushing your teeth) for the 3-6 months following removal of your braces. After 6 months, please wear your retainers when sleeping until you are 80 years old (or as long as you want your teeth to stay straight). On a regular basis, retainers should be brushed with a toothbrush and tooth paste to keep them clean. Periodically, soak the retainers in white vinegar or denture cleaning product at least 1.5 to 2 hrs, rinse them thoroghly with water, and use your toothbrush and toothpaste to remove loose debris from the wires and plastic parts of the retainer. When not in your mouth, put the retainers in the plastic case given to you. Do not put the retainer in hot water, because that will distort the plastic. Keep the retainers away from pets, who like to chew them. Do not wrap a retainer in a restaurant napkin and then discard the napkin after the meal. If a retainer breaks or is lost, please contact our office as soon as possible, because teeth can quickly move out of alignment, and re-treatment may be necessary. Take good care of your retainer, because a fee will be assessed for lost or broken retainers.
