<h3>VEGES</h3>
<h4>Three Groups of Vegetables</h4>
<p>IIn the great majority of cultivated vegetables it is possible to recognise to which part of a plant they belong: Is it the root, or stem, or leaves, or blossom, or fruit part, or seeds of a plant? [1] But there are a few vegetables where this is not so easy. For example, onions are swollen stems (as is visible from the similar structure of  the fennel bulb) but grow under the earth as roots do. Such plants are plants in between, having some characteristics of both groups. For that reason they are listed in one group with the additional group of which they have some characteristics in the brackets.  For example, onions are listed as root vegetable group with stem in brackets.</p>
<p>All fruits, seeds, and nuts belong to the Flower-Fruit-Seed group. There is one notable exception: peanuts. [4] They develop their seeds under the earth. This means that they are seeds, but with some root characteristics. The group Flower-Fruit-Seed also contains seeds which we can use instead of cereals, such as buckwheat, amaranth, quinoa, etc. These plants form typical flowers, while the flowers of cereals are – with the exception of maize – very similar to other parts of the cereal ear.</p>
