<p>First of all, I would like to thank <a href = "http://jmcglone.com">JONATHAN MCGLONE</a>! I really like his tutorial <a href = "http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub</a>, which is pretty streightforward.
</p>
<p>
I have experience in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Github, which are pretty useful when building this website. I will add some features from now and then to make it fresh.
