  First of all, I would like to thank <a href = "http://jmcglone.com">Jonathan McGlone</a> for his tutorial on <a href = "http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub</a>, which is pretty streightforward and helpful.
</p>
<p>
  Also, I would like to thank <a href = "http://rev365.com">Rev</a>, for giving me a chance working with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and Github, which are pretty useful when building this website. 
</p>
<p>
  I like the simplicity and functionality of this site, it is exactly what I want it to be. Great thanks to <a href = "https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. I will keep exploring and add some features from now and then. 
</p>

<p>
  Last but not least, I want to thank our powerful <a href = "http://google.com">Google</a>.
